    "\n",
    "Welcome to the **AutoGen Learning Lab**! In this lab, you'll simulate building a next-generation AI application using the **AutoGen framework** from Microsoft.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our use case is building an startup team using AI Agents. By the end, you'll not only familiar with AutoGen framework, but also **build a full AI Startup Team with multiple agents** that can work together to solve a complex task.\n"

    "## 🧠 2. AutoGen Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 What is AutoGen Framework?\n",
    "\n",
    "**AutoGen** is an open-source programming framework for building AI agents and facilitating cooperation among multiple agents to solve tasks. AutoGen aims to provide an easy-to-use and flexible framework for accelerating development and research on agentic AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Why Use AutoGen?\n",
    "\n",
    "The AutoGen offers a complete toolkit for designing, implementing, and managing AI agent systems, with a special emphasis on multi-agent collaboration. It abstracts away the complexity of prompt engineering, role-based coordination, and long-context memory management, allowing developers to focus on high-level workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Reasons to Use AutoGen:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multi-Agent Collaboration: AutoGen allows you to create applications where multiple AI agents, each with specialized roles, can communicate and cooperate to solve complex tasks-much like a human team. This is ideal for scenarios such as customer service bots, data analysis, content generation, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simplifies Complex Workflows: It streamlines the orchestration, automation, and optimization of intricate LLM workflows, making it easier to build, manage, and scale applications that would otherwise require significant engineering effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Customizable and Flexible: Developers can easily define agents with specific skills and behaviors, customize conversation patterns, and integrate human feedback when needed. This flexibility enables a wide range of use cases and allows for both autonomous and human-in-the-loop workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Efficient Code Execution: AutoGen supports automated code execution in secure, containerized environments, enabling agents to write, test, and debug code collaboratively and autonomously-speeding up development and reducing manual intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reduces Errors and Increases Consistency: By automating repetitive tasks and providing robust coordination between agents, AutoGen helps reduce human error and ensures consistent results across projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Open Source and Actively Developed: Backed by Microsoft and an active research community, AutoGen is open source, well-documented, and continuously improved, making it accessible and reliable for developers.\n"

    "\n",
    "In AutoGen, llm_config is a dictionary that defines how an agent interacts with a large language model (LLM) such as GPT-4o. It controls the agent’s model behavior, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Which model to use (e.g., OpenAI GPT-4, Azure OpenAI Model)\n",
    "- Endpoint settings and API configuration\n",
    "- Model generation style (e.g., creative vs deterministic)\n",
    "- Tool usage (e.g., code execution tools)\n",
